<p align="center"> A mod for NFSU2 + more to allow custom music without overwriting game files </p>

# How To Use
### [Mr. Modman](https://github.com/VelocityCL/mr.modman):
Extract the files from the `scripts` folder into your game's global directory or pack directory. Ie. only the `ecm.x86.asi` and the `bass.dll`.
Make a `Music` folder where you put it.

### ASI Loader:
If you already have `dinput8.dll` in your game directory, extract the release zip into your game folder and make a new folder called `Music` inside your scripts folder.

# Installing Songs
Place any wav, mp1, mp2, mp3, ogg, or aif file into your `Music` folder.

# Overlay
Press F11 while in-game to access the overlay. This will show `Actions`, `Playlist`, and the current song playing. 
Actions contains `Volume` and a `Skip` button. 
Playlist contains the songs as buttons to instantly play them.
